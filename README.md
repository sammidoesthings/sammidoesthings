### Here are some of the things I've learned:

🎯 | failing sucks, unless you have to fail to win. winning is always fun!

( ▷) |  you can make anything you want if you can find a youtube tutorial for it

💯 | doing things halfway will result in feeling only halfway about it, so go all in!

🦄🐳 | narwhals ARE real and they aren't seals. They're actually in the same family as the beluga whale. Oh, and they have flexible rib cages and collapsible lungs. Ew.
