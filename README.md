# Hello, friends! ✨

I'm Sammi, and here's where I do things--specifically, CODE things! 

Well, technically, I code the things from my little apartment in San Francisco...But you get to see it here!

### 📌 My Current Projects: 

I'm sharpening my skills in React JS 🔪 
- 👑 my development portfolio
- 🌴 an Animal Crossing: New Horizons Island Planner using <a href="https://api.nookipedia.com/">the Nookipedia API</a>

I'm learning Python 🧠 
- 🕸 a web scraper for Substack/Newsletter writers
- ⛏ custom Minecraft puzzle maps w/ <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/homepage">Minecraft: Education Edition</a>

### Things I've Learned:

( ▷) |  you can make anything you want if you can find a youtube tutorial for it

🦄🐳 | narwhals ARE real and they aren't seals. They're actually in the same family as the beluga whale. Oh, and they have flexible rib cages and collapsible lungs. Ew.
